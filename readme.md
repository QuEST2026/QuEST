# Official Code for Paper QuEST: Quantization-conditioned Efficient Stealthy Trojan

* The current codebase allows for full reproduction of the results presented in our paper. However, due to time constraints, the code is not yet optimized for usability and readability.

* We appreciate your attention and plan to release a more user-friendly, well-documented version of the code along with pre-trained checkpoints upon paper acceptance.

* All experiments were conducted using the provided Python environment on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
